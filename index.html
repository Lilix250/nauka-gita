        <h1> Hallelujah</h1>
        <p class="info">by Leonard Cohen</p>
        <p>I've heard there was a secret chord<br>
            That David played, and it pleased the Lord<br>
            But you don't really care for music, do you?<br>
            It goes like this the fourth, the fifth<br>
            The minor fall, the major lift<br>
            The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br><br>
            
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br><br>
            
            Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
            You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
            Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you<br>
            She tied you to a kitchen chair<br>
            She broke your throne, and she cut your hair<br>
            And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah<br><br>
            
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah</p>
        <p>Release date: <span class="info">1984r.</span></p>
